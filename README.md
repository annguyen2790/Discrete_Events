#Discrete events:

This program stimulate the process of how a CPU handles events(jobs) when there are many events running at the same time between the CPU and disk                                            Basic: Jobs will be filled inside the CPU queue, if the CPU is opened, the those jobs will be processed. Otherwise, there will be an event handlers that will place he jobs in either disk1 or disk2 queue, quit, or even exit the CPU  based on the state of the jobs
