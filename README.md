#Discrete Event
9/1/2019
Basic Plan:
A)Create a queue ---> add/delete Job from queue
B)Create a prioprity queue -----> add Job to queue
C) Some logics to stimulate the events of the CPU
In order to stimulate a cpu event scheduling process, two types of data structure will be needed: a queue and priority queue
1. Implement a basic queue and its common method: insert_queue, pop, isEmpty

2. Implement insert_Pqueue, which acts as an insertion of priority queue based on time of the job
